Title: Manage File Permissions

Description: 
  Create a new file named `perm_file1` in the `/home/labex` directory.
  Set initial read permissions for owner, group, and other.
  Add execute permission for the owner and write permissions for group and other.
  Revoke the write bit from other (public).
  Assign read, write, and execute bits to all three user categories simultaneously.
  Revoke write permission from the owning group and revoke both write and execute bits from other (public).

Requirements: 
  All operations must be performed in the `/home/labex` directory.
    Use the `touch` command to create the file.
    Use the `chmod` command with both symbolic and octal notation to modify permissions as follows:
    Initially set permissions to read-only (444) for all user categories.
    Use symbolic notation for all subsequent permission changes.
    The final permissions for perm_file1 should be:
      Owner: read, write, and execute (rwx)
      Group: read and execute (r-x)
      Other: read only (r--)

Output:
$ ls -l perm_file1
-rwxr-xr-- 1 labex labex 0 Aug 28 07:14 perm_file1
