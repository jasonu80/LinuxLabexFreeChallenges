Title: Add New User and Group
Description: 
  Create new groups named `dev` and `test`.
  Add a new user account named `jack` with a home directory of `/home/jack`, primary group `dev`, and secondary group `labex`.
  Add a new user account named `bob` with a home directory of `/home/bob`, primary group `test`, and secondary group `labex`.
Requirements:
  Use the `labex` user, which has `sudo` privileges and belongs to the `labex` user group, to perform these tasks.
  Ensure that the new groups `dev` and `test` are created before adding the users.
  Ensure that the new users are created with their respective home directories and group memberships.
  You can choose either of these approaches:
    Create groups first, then create users, and finally add them to groups
    Create users with their group memberships in a single command

Output:
$ id jack
uid=5001(jack) gid=5003(dev) groups=5003(dev),5000(labex)

$ id bob
uid=5002(bob) gid=5004(test) groups=5004(test),5000(labex)
